UnitCalculator
==============

Simple Python Module for Unit Conversion
This Module is distributet under MIT License and
should be used freely.

Version
=======

Version 0.2

Installation
============

Change into your desired directory (e.g. your home directory) and
execute

git clone https://github.com/maldun/UnitCalculator.git

Usage
=====

We assume here that the module is installed in the home directory.
In (I)Python:

In [1]: import os

In [2]: os.chdir(os.path.expanduser("~"))

In [3]: from UnitCalculator import *

In [4]: kg() # Default

Out[4]: 1.0

In [5]: kg(T) # Convert kg to Ton

Out[5]: 0.001

In [6]: auto_converter(mmNS) # Start automatic conversion to mm and T system

In [7]: kg()

Out[7]: 0.001

In [8]: auto_converter(SI) # Convert to SI

In [9]: 1000*mm() # Convert 1000mm to SI m

Out[9]: 1.0

In [10]: auto_converter(mmNS) 

In [11]: 8050*(kg()/m()**3) # Converts density of steel from kg/m^3 to T/mm^3

Out[11]: 8.05e-09

In [12]: N/m**2 # Since Version 0.2 direct algebra use is also supported

Out[12]: 1e-06

In [13]: gramm = KiloGrammUnit(1e-3) # Easy (re)definition of units

In [14]: 8050*(kg/m**3) # Converts density of steel from kg/m^3 to T/mm^3 since v0.2

Out[14]: 8.05e-09



In fact the commands kg(), kg(T), m() etc. only return the conversion factors between two units,
so don't forget the multiplication symbol!

Usage in Code Aster
===================

Add to your .comm file (Assuming the module is installed in home):

import sys

sys.path.append(os.path.expanduser("~"))

from UnitCalculator import *

Example in .comm file
=====================

import sys

# Assuming module is in home directory

sys.path.append(os.path.expanduser("~"))

from UnitCalculator import *

auto_converter(mmNS)

DEBUT();

#define material --> steel
MA=DEFI_MATERIAU(ELAS=_F(E=2.1e+11*Pa, # automatically --> 2.1e+5 MPa 
                         NU=0.3,
			 RHO=8050*(kg/m**3), # automatically --> 8.05e-09 T/mm**3
			 ),
		);
...

Supportet Units

Energy: J, mJ

Predefined Unit Sets
====================

class SystemeInternationale(UnitSystem): # SI
    """
    Container class for SI units
    """
    def __init__(self):
        
        self._distance = m
        self._mass = kg
        self._pressure = Pa 
        self._force = N
        self._time = sec
        self._radiant = rad
        self._temperature = degK
        self._power = W
        self._energy = J

class MeterKilogrammSec(UnitSystem): # MKS
    """
    Container class for SI units 
    in Meter Kilogramm and Seconds,
    but with Degree in Celsius
    """
    def __init__(self):
        
        self._distance = m
        self._mass = kg
        self._pressure = Pa 
        self._force = N
        self._time = sec
        self._radiant = rad
        self._temperature = degC
        self._power = W
        self._energy = J


class MilimiterAndTon(UnitSystem): # mmNS
    """
    Container class for SI units
    with distance in mm and
    mass in tons
    """
    def __init__(self):
        
        self._distance = mm
        self._mass = T
        self._pressure = MPa 
        self._force = N
        self._time = sec
        self._radiant = rad
        self._temperature = degC
        self._power = mW
        self._energy = mJ

Custom Units and Unitsets
=========================

To Create your own units, e.g. to create
micrometer, simply add 

mum = MeterUnit(1e-6) # Example for µm unit

What is this? MeterUnit is the Unit base class for
length units, where the standard unit is meter. The
factor 1e-6 is the conversion factor to meter (1 µm = 1e-6 m).

another example for foot:

ft = MeterUnit(0.3048)

You can also define a whole new base unit. 
For example use foot as new Unit base for lengths add

class FootUnit(PhysicalUnit):
      pass

Then you can define other units which use foot as base e.g.:

ft = FootUnit() # Base unit
yard = FootUnit(3.0) # Derived unit

To define a new Unit set add it like:

class MilimiterAndTon(UnitSystem): # mmNS
    """
    Container class for SI units
    with distance in mm and
    mass in tons
    """
    def __init__(self):
        
        self._distance = mm
        self._mass = T
        self._pressure = MPa 
        self._force = N
        self._time = sec
        self._radiant = rad
        self._temperature = degC
        self._power = mW
        self._energy = mJ

Feel free to add your unit systems and units to the UnitCalculator.py file and
push them to my repo on github!
